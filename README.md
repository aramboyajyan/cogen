# Cogen

### General purpose code generation and automation script

This is a very open-ended CLI application for generating code based on custom templates and performing repetitive tasks automatically.  
It allows you to define your own templates, replacement patterns and additional commands to perform once the cloning is done.

An example would be the following workflow:

1. Copy `my-ultimate-project-boilerplate` in current working directory
2. Replace all instances of `{page title}` with `My New Project`
3. Remove all old git folders
4. Initiate a new git repository with my username and email
5. Commit everything as 'initial commit generated by cogen'

The main purpose of the script is to avoid boilerplate code and allow you to replace all placeholders at once.  
All this is performed without you leaving the terminal, going back and forth different files and running a dozen of replaces for every new project.

Note: there are some tools that are similar up to certain extent (e.g. [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)), but unlike them, Cogen is not limited to one programming language, framework or code at all.

### Installation

Coming soon. Planning to make it very straightforward with `[pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)`.

### Usage

Coming soon.

### Contributing

Fork, add your code, pull and explain. As easy as that. Every contribution/suggestion is welcome :)
